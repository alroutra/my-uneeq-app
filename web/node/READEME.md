## Example Digital Human Web Frontend (node)
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to create a basic web frontend using the uneeq-js NPM package
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/uneeq-js).

This demo supports the following:
- Retrieval of a session token used to create a UneeQ session.
- Creation of a UneeQ session with uneeq-js npm package.
- Establishment of a UneeQ digital human video stream.
- Push to talk (spacebar) to speak to the digital human.
- Handling of user speech to text messages and display on screen.
- Handling of digital human answer messages and display on screen.

#### Dependencies
- Node version 8 or higher
- NPM version 6 or higher

#### Running Locally
`npm install` to install dependencies from package.json.
<br/>
`npm start` to compile bundle.js and run a webserver. bundle.js is imported into index.html and includes the uneeq-js library. This will
watch for changes to main.js and recompile bundle.js automatically (using watchify). The webserver will run on 127.0.0.1
and serve index.html
<br/>

- `GET_TOKEN_URL` The customer built token service.
- `UNEEQ_URL` The UneeQ server you will retrieve the token from.
- `UNEEQ_WORKSPACE` The conversation workspace you want to generate a token for.

`UNEEQ_URL` & `UNEEQ_WORKSPACE` should match values used to generate token. Be sure to update these values before
running the example app, this can be done in main.js

Once compiled, open index.html in your web browser. Clicking the 'Start Digital Human' button will cause the page to
request a session token from your token service. Once a token is retrieved it will be used to start a digital human
session. After a few seconds you will see the digital human on screen. You can press and hold the spacebar key to speak
to the digital human.

Your browsers javascript console will log any errors that occur.
